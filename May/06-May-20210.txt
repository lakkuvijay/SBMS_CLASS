Yesterday's session : Stereotype annotations
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> To represent java class as Spring Bean we will use Stereo Type annotations

@Component
@Service
@Repository

-> To represent java class as configuration class we will use @Configuration annotation.

Note: When we want to perform customized configuration then we will do that by using Configuration class with the help of @Configuration annotation.

-> If programmer wants to create object for the class and wants to represent that as Spring Bean then we will use @Bean annotation.

Note: @Bean annotation is method level annotation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Configuration
public class AppConfig{
    
     @Bean
     public DataSource getDataSource(){
		DataSource ds = new DataSource();
                   ds.setUname(uname);
		   ds.setPwd(Decryptor.decrypt(pwd));
			//set all values

		return ds;
     }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> In application development we will use @Bean for below scenarios

			-> DataSource creation
			-> Swagger Docket obj creation
			-> Spring Security Configuration
			-> Kafka Producer Configuration
			-> Kafka Consumer Configuration etc...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Component Scan will start from base package. After base package scanning completed it will scan all sub packages in alphabetical order.

Note: @Bean annotated methods will be called at the end (after all packages are scanned).


-> @Bean annotated method can be available in any Spring Bean class but it is recommended to keep in Configuration class.
