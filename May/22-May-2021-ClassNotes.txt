Last session : Doubts clarifications

Today's session : CrudRepository provided methods
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Spring Data Jpa provided repository interfaces to perform DB operations

	1) CrudRepository
	2) JpaRepository

-> CrudRepository provided methods to perform only crud operations

-> JpaRepository provided methods to perform crud operations + pagination + sorting also.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> If our interface extending the properties from JPA interfaces then we no need to write single line of code also to perform crud operations.

-> When we create our interface by extending jpa repository interface then implementation class will be created in the run time for our interface. By using that implementation class object we can call the methods to perform DB operations.

		Note: Implementation class is a proxy class.


CrudRepository interface methods
--------------------------------
save ( ) : To insert one record

saveAll ( ) : To insert collection of records

Note: We don't have update method.... save( ) method is polymorphic method. If primary key already exist then it will update the record else it will insert the record.

findById( ) : To retrieve record using Primary Key

findAllById ( ) : To retrieve records using multiple primary keys.

findAll ( ) : To retrieve all records available in table

existsById ( ) : To check presense of the record

count ( ): To check total no.of records in available in table.

deleteById ( ) : To delete a record using Primary Key

deleteAllById ( ) : To delete multiple records using primary keys

delete(E obj) : To delete record using entity obj

deleteAll ( ) : To delete all records from the table.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> In Data JPA we can perform DB operations in 3 ways

	1) Using predefined methods
	2) By Writing findBy methods
	3) By Using Custom Queries
