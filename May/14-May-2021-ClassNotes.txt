Last session : Field Injection In Spring
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> When we specify @Autowired annotation at variable evel then IOC will perform Field Injection.

-> To perform Field Injection IOC will internally uses Reflection API.

Note: Using Reflection API we can access private variables outside of the class also but it is not recommended approach.

-> With in one target class we can declare multiple dependent beans and we can injecting them using Field Injection.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Field Injection is not recommended ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Internally it will use Reflection Api to inject value into private variable outside of the class which is against OOPS principles.

-> With Field Injection if we inject too many dependencies our class will violates Single Responsibility Principle.
