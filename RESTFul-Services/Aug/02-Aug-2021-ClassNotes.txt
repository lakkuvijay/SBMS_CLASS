Last Session : WebClient
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> WebClient got introduced in Spring 5.x version

-> Using WebClient api we can develop rest clients

-> Webclient supports for both Synchronus and Asynchronus communication

-> To use WebClient in our application we have to add below dependency in pom.xml file

	spring-boot-starter-webflux   (Reactive Web)
	

	WebClient webClient = WebClient.create( );

	String response = webClient.get( )
			 .uri(endpointUrl)
			 .retrieve( )
			 .bodyToMono(String.class)
			 .block( );

	    //further logic to deal with response
