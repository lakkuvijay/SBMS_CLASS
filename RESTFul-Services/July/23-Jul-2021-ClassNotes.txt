Today's session : REST Client
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What is Rest Client?

Ans) Any program which is capable of sending http request to server is called as Rest Client

Note: Any body can act as client for Rest api

	1) Browser
	2) POSTMAN
	3) Swagger UI
	4) Program
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> By using Spring mvc we can develop Rest Client in 2 ways

		1) RestTemplate
		2) WebClient

-> RestTemplate is a predefined class which supports for Synchronus communication. This is old approach.

-> Synchronus means after making a request it will wait for response.

-> WebClient got introduced in Spring 5.x version. It supports both Synchronus and Asynchronus communications. It is trending in the market.

-> Asynchronus means after making a request without waiting for response it will continue its execution.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-> In order to start rest client development we should know API details

-> API team will provide API documentation to client team using Swagger.

-> Client side team should understand API documentation and start client development based on documentation
