-> REST APIs we are developing for business to business communications (B 2 B).

-> REST Apis are distributed applications with intereoperability.

-> When we are developing distributed applications one application will act as Resource Application and another application will act as client application.

-> If client wants to access our API they should know details of our api.

-> Resource App development team should provide API documentation to Client App development team.

-> API documentation should contain below details

		3) consumes formats
		4) produces formats
