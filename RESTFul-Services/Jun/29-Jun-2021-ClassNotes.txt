Last session : What is Distributed application & why ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> If one application is communicating with another application then it is called as Distributed application.

-> With the help of distributed application we can re-use business services.

-> Distributed applications are meant for business to business communication.

		Passport app -----------> Aadhar app

		Makemytrip app ----------> Air Lines, Hotels, irctc..

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> To develop Distributed applications we will use Webservices.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Webservice?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Webservices is a distributed technology which is used to develop distributed applications with Intereoperability
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Intereoperability?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irrespective of the platform and irrespective of the programming language if applications are communicating then they are called as Intereoperable applications.


			Java <--------> .Net

			Python <-------> Salesforce

			Angular <------> Java

			Python <--------> Java
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> In distributed applications consumer & provider applications will exchange the data.


-> Provider application will decide input data structure & output data structure.

Note: The data which is exchanging between consumer and provider should be intereoperable.

-> XML, JSON and YML are universal data formats for exchanging data in webservices.

Note: In distributed applications we should not exchange the data in object format.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> In Java we can develop distributed applications with Intereoperability in 2 ways

		1) Webservices (SOAP Webservices)
		2) RESTful Services
