Today's session (4th session) - Spring Boot Advantages & Dis-Advantages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Spring Boot?
--------------------
-> Spring Boot is an approach to develop Spring Based applications with minimal or less configurations.

-> What ever the applications we can develop by using Spring same type of applications can be developed by using Spring Boot also.

		1) Standalone apps
		2) Web apps
		3) Distributed apps (Webservices & Restful Services)

-> We can't say spring boot is replacing spring because Spring Boot is internally using Spring framework only.

Advantages of Spring Boot
--------------------------
1) Starter poms
2) Auto Configuration
3) Embedded Servers
4) Actuators
5) Embedded Databases Integration
6) Rapid Application Development


-> Starter poms are used to reduce maven configuration. Spring Boot provided several starters like below

		spring-boot-starter
		spring-boot-starter-web
		spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
		spring-boot-starter-actuator
		spring-boot-starter-mail etc...

-> Spring Boot main advantage is AutoConfiguration. Based on Starter poms spring boot will identify what configuration is required to run our application and it will provide that configuration.

	Ex: FrontController Configuration
            Web Application Deployment

-> Spring Boot is providing Embedded Servers to run our applications.

-> Deploying Web application to server is an universal requirement. As everybody requires to setup server and deployment boot people has automated deployment process using Embedded Servers.

-> Spring Boot provided Several Embedded servers for us

		1)tomcat (default)
		2)jetty
		3)netty
		4)undertow

Note: We can deploy Spring Boot application into external servers also.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Spring Boot provided actuators which are used to provide production ready features of our applications.

		1) What is health of application

		2) How many objects created in our app

		3) How much memory utilized

		4) How many classes loaded

		5) how many threads are running

		6) What are the config props loaded

		7) What are the last 100 requests came to our app


-> Spring Boot is having very good integration support with Embedded Databases like h2, derby etc...

-> Now a days in industry spring boot is mainly using to develop Microservices Based applications (Rest apis)

-> We can develop applications very easily & quickly by using spring boot because boot will provide auto configuration. Spring Boot is supporting for Rapid application development by providing infrastructure which is required for our application.
