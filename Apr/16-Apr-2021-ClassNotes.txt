What is Spring?
-----------------
-> Spring is an application development Framework

-> By using Spring framework we can develop end to end application
		1) Presentation Layer
		2) Web Layer
		3) Business/Service Layer
		4) Persistence Layer

-> By using Spring framework we can develop below types of applications

		1) Standalone applications
		2) Web Applications (Customer 2 Business)
		3) Distributed Applications (Business 2 Business)

-> Standalone applications will run in one system

	Ex : Notepad, Calculator, Eclipse , SQL Developer etc...

-> The application which runs over internet is called as Web Application. Multiple users can access web application at a time. Webapplications are meant for C 2 B.

	Ex : Facebook, IRCTC, Gmail, Ashokit.in

-> If one application is communicating with another application then they are called as Distributed Applications. Distributed applications are meant for Business to Business Communication.

	Ex : Passport --------> AADHAR
	     E-Comm   --------> Payment Gateways
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> The problem with spring framework is we have to manage configurations manually.

-> To simpliy configurations in the application Spring Team released Spring Boot.

-> Spring Boot is not a seperate framework

-> We should not say that Spring Boot is replacement for Spring.

-> Spring Boot is an approach to develop Spring Based Applications with Minimal or less configurations.
