  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-xgZHTJHl0)

Last Saturday & Sunday Classes were not there
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Today - Spring Boot & Microservices - ( Session - 03 )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Spring Boot ?
---------------------
-> Spring Boot is an approach to develop spring based applications with minimal or less configurations.

Note: Spring Boot is not replacement for Spring Framework because Spring Boot is developed on top of Spring framework only.

-> Spring Boot is promoting spring framework.

What type of applications can be developed by using spring framework?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Standalone application (Specific to one machine)

		Ex: Eclipse, Notepad, MS Office, Calc

-> Web applications (Runs over internet)

		Ex: gmail, irctc, facebook, ashokit.in

-> Distributed applications (Webservices)

		Ex: Passport ---> AADHAR, Zomato ---> Payment Gateways

What type of applications can be developed by using Spring Boot?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
What type of applications can be developed by using Spring same type of applications can be developed by using Spring Boot also.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> If we develop the applications using Spring framework then we have take care of lot of configurations.

-> If we develop the applications by using spring boot we no need to take care of configurations because Spring Boot Came up with "AUTO CONFIGURATION" support.

-> Auto configuration means it will identify what configuration is required to run our application and it will provide that configuration.

Ex:
---
-> If we develop web application by using Spring Boot
	
	-> It will configure DispatcherServlet as a front controller
	-> It will configure view resolver to resolve view files (jsp, thymeleaf)
	-> It will provide server also to run our application.

Note: If we use plain spring all the above 3 steps we have to do manually. Boot will provide all those 3 steps as part of Auto Configuration.

-> Spring Boot is an approach to develop spring based applications with minimal or less configurations.

What are the advantages of Spring Boot
--------------------------------------
1) Starter Poms

2) Auto Configuration

3) Embedded Servers

4) Actuators

5) Rapid application development

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Starter poms are used to reduce maven configuration in pom.xml file. Spring Boot provided several starter poms like below

	spring-boot-starter (for standalone applications)

	spring-boot-starter-web (for web & distributed applications)

	spring-boot-starter-data-jpa (for Persistence layer)

	spring-boot-stater-mail (For java mail api)
	
	spring-boot-starter-test (For Unit Testing)

-> Based on Starter Poms spring boot will identify configuration which is required for our application and will proivde that in runtime.


-> Spring Boot is providing Embedded Servers to run our web applications as part 'spring-boot-starter-web' dependency.

		1) Apache Tomcat (Default)
		2) Jetty
		3) Netty

Note: If required we can deploy boot applications into external servers also like Weblogic, Websphere, jboss etc..
