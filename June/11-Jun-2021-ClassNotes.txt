1) FrontController
2) HandlerMapper
3) Controller
4) ModelAndView
5) ViewResolver
6) View

What is FrontController?
----------------------------
-> FrontController is responsible to perform pre-processing and post-processing of a request.

-> In Spring Web MVC, DispatcherServlet will act as Front Controller

-> DispatcherServlet is a pre-defined class.


What is HandlerMapper?
----------------------
-> HandlerMapper is a pre-defined component available in Spring Web MVC

-> HandlerMapper is responsible to identify Request Handler class for incoming request.

-> From Spring 3.0 onwards RequestMappingHandlerMapper is executing as Default HandlerMapper.

What is Controller?
---------------------
-> Controller is web component which is responsible to handle web request

-> Controller is also called as Request Handler

-> To represent java class as a Controller we will use @Controller annotation.

What is ModelAndView?
---------------------
-> After handling the request, controller method will return ModelAndView object.

-> Model is a map which stores the data in the form of Key-Value pair

-> Model is used to send the data to presentation layer in key-value format.

-> View Represents Logical view name that should be rendered as a response.

Note: In Spring Web MVC, Controller don't know where the view files will be available and what is the view technology.

What is View Resolver?
----------------------
-> View Resolver is used to identify location of view files and view technology

-> We will configure ViewResolver with prefix and suffix

	prefix ------> Represents view files location
	suffix ------> Represents view files extension

What is View?
-------------
-> View Component is used to render model data in view file
