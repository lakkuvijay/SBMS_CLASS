Last session : First Web App Development using Spring Boot

Today's session : Methods in Controller class & Multiple Controllers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> To develop web application using Spring Boot we have to add below starter in pom.xml file

		spring-boot-starter-web

-> When we add spring-boot-starter-web dependency it will get 'Tomact' as default container.

-> Default Container runs on port number 8080. If we want to change that port number we have to write below property in application.properties file

		server.port = 9090

-> To represent class as a controller, we will use @Controller annotation.

-> Inside controller class we will write multiple methods and we will bind those methods to Http Protocol methods using below annotations

	GET Request ->	@GetMapping
	POST Request -> @PostMapping
	PUT Request -> @PutMapping
	DELETE Request -> @DeleteMapping

Note: Earlier people used to work with @RequestMapping annotation to bind controller methods to Http Protocol methods.

		@RequestMapping(value="", method=POST)
