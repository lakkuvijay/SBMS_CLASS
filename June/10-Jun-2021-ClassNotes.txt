Today's session : Spring Web MVC Module (Part-3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Spring Web MVC is one module available in Spring Framework

-> By Using Spring Web MVC module we can develop below types of applications

		1) Web Applications ( C 2 B )
		2) Distributed Applications (B 2 B)

-> Spring Boot also uses Spring Web MVC module internally to develop web applications.

-> Spring Web MVC module is developed based on 2 design patterns

		1) MVC Design Pattern
		2) Front Controll Design Pattern


MVC Design Pattern
-------------------
-> MVC stands for Model, View and Controller

-> Model represents data

-> View represents presentation logic

-> Controller is responsible for handling request (Mediator btwn Model and View)

-> MVC design pattern is used to develop our applications with loosely coupling.

FrontController Design Pattern
------------------------------
-> Spring MVC module is using front controller design pattern to deal with pre-processing and post-processing of a request.

-> In Spring MVC 'DispatcherServlet' acting as Front Controller.

Note: DispatcherServlet is a predefined class available in Spring MVC module.


Advantages of Spring Web MVC Module
-----------------------------------
-> Supports for developing both web applications and distributed applications

-> Spring Web MVC application can deal with multiple presentation technologies

		1) JSP
		2) Thymeleaf

-> Spring MVC supports for Form Binding

Note: Form Binding means form data will be stored in object and object data will be displayed in the form.

-> Spring MVC supports flexibility in form binding (It will take care of typecasting)

-> It is having Front Controller to deal with Pre-Processing and Post-Processing of a request.


Spring Web MVC Components
-------------------------
1) FrontController
2) HandlerMapper
3) Controller
4) ModelAndView
5) ViewResolver
6) View


-> FrontController is responsible to deal with Pre-Processing and Post-Processing of request.

-> HandlerMapper is responsible to identify Controller to handle the request

-> Controller is responsible for Request Handling

-> Model represents response data and view respresents web page name to display as a response.

-> ViewResolver is used to identify view file location

-> View is responsible to render model data in view file.
